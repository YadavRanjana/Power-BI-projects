This is my first project from Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence, taught by an excellent tutor and mentor Chris Dutton. I have created an interactive dashboard of my project from Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence learning.

It includes the Exact summary, Product Details and Customer Details.

Exact summary: Gives us the quick peek of the Total orders by category, Total orders by Sub-Category and date range. It displays the Monthly Revenue, Monthly Orders and Monthly Returns on the basis of selection. It also shows the top orders placed by the customer and Top profit to those Top orders. We have an additional Map view within our Summary page. It shows the specific region as per the selection we make.

It has a View Product Detail option at the bottom, which provides us the detailed summary of the selected individual product and the push us to the Product details page in Power Bi.

It has been divided into 3 categories, Orders by gender, Orders by Income Level and Orders by Occupation. We have Total orders and revenue by Start of Month. Furthermore, total orders by customer's current age. Lastly, it allows us to select and see the order details of any selected customer.
